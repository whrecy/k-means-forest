# k-means-forest
This is a classification algorithm for high dimension data that contains attribute noise.
The compressed file(k-means forest(matlab)) contains three m files, and kmeanforest.m is the main function.
k-means forest(C) contains two files. One is a C file and the other is an H header file.
k-means forest(MPI&C) is the MPI parallelized version.
